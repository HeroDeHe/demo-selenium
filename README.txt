A keyword Selenium Webdriver project.Some description project

Have done
- The Web driver should be not null when execute testcase
- Build Selenium Webdriver pattern: attributies and data read from properties file
- We have keywords and we will use define testcase. It is easer if we wanna maintenance
- We have utils method, define random data and check result

Run testcase
- The project should use JRE 1.8 above
- On demo.com package - Open DemoTesting class
- Right click - Select Run As option and select Java Application
(If you want change the testcase to execute - define on DemoTesting class)
- Check result on command line

Issues
- The http://demo.guru99.com/V4 site it is not complete. 
Do not have requirement for UI layout. We do not know how to a function work?
- The Xpath may be get duplicated
- The Webdriver is null, element null and can not get element

Improve
- Attribute and Data wanna read from excel file
- Good report with step clearly and include image
